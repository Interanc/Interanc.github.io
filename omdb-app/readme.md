# amiibo Wiki Page!

## Description:
This app is designed to populate multiple amiibo images and display them, and when you click on a image it then pops up a table. Which has the amiibo series its released from, the game series it comes from, the release date, type, and a bigger image. Also includes a search bar for better filtering, built in search link, and type filtering.

### Technologies Used:
Jquery to generate the list from an api.
HTML for the title and search buttons.
CSS for background and title animation.

### Approach Taken:
Created a self populating wrapper, then built search parameters around it.

### Installation Instructions:
Either clone the repo and run index.html or go to the live site.

### Instructions:
The list will not generate unless you either click the button or select a filter option. This is to cut down on the load times since the api contains 700+ items.

### Unsolved Problem:
Cannot click a button twice, but if you regenerate the page you can use it the same.
