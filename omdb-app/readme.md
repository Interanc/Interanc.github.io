amiibo Wiki Page!

This app is designed to populate multiple amiibo images and display them, and when you click on a image it then pops up a table, with the amiibo series its released from, the game series it comes from, the release date, type, and a bigger image. Also includes a search bar for better filtering, and type filtering.

Technologies Used: Jquery to generate the list from an api. HTML for the title and search buttons. CSS for background and title animation.
Approach Taken: Created a self populating wrapper, then built search parameters around it.

Installation Instructions: Either clone the repo and run index.html or go to the live site.
Instructions: The list wont generate unless you either click the button or select a filter option. This is to cut down on the load times since its 700+ items.
Unsolved Problem: Cannot click a button twice, but if you regenerate the page you can use it the same.
